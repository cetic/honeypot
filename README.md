# Integration of a honeypot solution into a DevSecOps pipeline in an Edge computing context

## Introduction

In the information technology world, attacks are constant and devices connected to the Internet are continually scanned by hackers. Their goals are to find valuable data, critical applications and vulnerabilities in network infrastructures. The honeypot is by vocation, an information system, more or less artificial, whose main purpose is to be probed, attacked and possibly compromised in order to make a hacker believe that he has penetrated into the real network of the organization. Thanks to the honeypot, the hacker is removed from the real network and his activities and movements can be captured and monitored. The information collected on the hackers makes it possible to study their methods, their motivations and the attack techniques they use to penetrate or corrupt a system. The goal is to develop ways to improve system security and prevent attacks in the future.
