 ## Methodology 
 * Taxonomy honeypots
  * Definition of criteria for honeypot ranking 
  * Studies of existing solutions 
* DevSecOps
 * Explanations of the concepts -> DevOps + Sec 
 * Integrations of a protection tool / Detection ( /!\!= IDS) 
 * Choice of honeypot solutions conducive to the integration of a DevSecOps mechanism -> Use Case
* Edge Computing 
 * Link with IoT / IIoT 
 * Link to DevSecOps 
 * Link with honeypots 
* Use Case
 * Definition of an interesting use case to test the solution 
 * Implementation 
 * Outcome studies 

## Concepts

* honeyfarm, honeynet, honey-patching, honey-trapping
